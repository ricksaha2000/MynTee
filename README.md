## Inspiration

We wanted to build a one stop application connecting all the users to fashion stores ranging from local shop-owners to established enterprises for effective and smooth fashion items, apparel and accessory discovery. A multi-auth system enabling smart communication, reducing distance gap, providing maximum support to the end users would be really useful and help in this noble cause.
